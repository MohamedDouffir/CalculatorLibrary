What is CI(_Continuous Integration)?

Quote from Martin Fowler (developer and author ) about CI:

“Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.” (Source)
